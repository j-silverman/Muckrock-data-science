# Muckrock-data-science

### CS506 Project Proposal
## Topic:
We are working with MuckRock, a non-profit company whose goal is to encourage transparency by providing an accessible way for the public to file for information from different government agencies, and by building a public repository of this information. Our mission is to pull data on government conversations and run robust analytics. We will be using trending twitter topics, natural language processing and sentiment analysis to assess these conversations.
## Questions: 
-	What are the most common topics being talked about by government agencies on twitter?
- How does the topic of conversation on Twitter in different government agencies change after a traumatic event (e.g. a mass shooting) and how long does that conversation last for?
-	What are the differences in conversation between state, local and federal government?
-	What are the differences in conversations according to geographical differences?
-	How do the conversations on certain topics vary/differ between the media (i.e. various news platforms) and the agencies’ social media?

## Datasets:

For datasets, we will start with MuckRock’s existing database that contains roughly 9,000 agencies to gather twitter accounts to be used. From there, we will be using the Twitter API to gather real-time twitter data from the different agencies selected. Politawoops is an open-source platform that collects deleted tweets from politicians in or running for office, which will contribute to our twitter data. NewsAPI.org provides an API for collecting news/media headlines and topics to be used in analysis.
